> Our team is currently working on making Dobbins Air Force Base’s two electronic billboards operational again. Our client is Dobbins Air Force Base ops team and more specifically Colonel Terence Green and Dr. Patrick Reynolds. One of the project restrictions is that we cannot use wi-fi to transmit messages due to the fact that we are implementing a solution for the Air Force Base.  
Our solution has a web application front end that will be hosted on a Raspberry Pi in a control room. There, billboard operators will load images/videos onto the Raspberry Pi via a usb drive from which they can insert the files into the web application. The Raspberry Pi in the control room, will then reformat the aspect ratios of the images/videos to match the billboard they are being sent to. Then, the images/videos are sent via ethernet to a second Raspberry Pi that is connected directly to, and controlling, the billboard. This second Raspberry Pi will play the images/videos on a loop until new instructions are sent to it.
