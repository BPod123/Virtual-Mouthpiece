> Our team is currently working on making Dobbins Air Force Base‚Äôs two electronic billboards operational again. Our client is Dobbins Air Force Base ops team and more specifically Colonel Terence Green and Dr. Patrick Reynolds. One of the project restrictions is that we cannot use wi-fi to transmit messages due to the fact that we are implementing a solution for the Air Force Base.  
Our solution has a web application front end that will be hosted on a Raspberry Pi in a control room. There, billboard operators will load images/videos onto the Raspberry Pi via a usb drive from which they can insert the files into the web application. The Raspberry Pi in the control room, will then reformat the aspect ratios of the images/videos to match the billboard they are being sent to. Then, the images/videos are sent via ethernet to a second Raspberry Pi that is connected directly to, and controlling, the billboard. This second Raspberry Pi will play the images/videos on a loop until new instructions are sent to it.

# Installation
Virtual-Mouthpiece can be installed in three simple steps.
1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.9 or higher
2. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 16 or higher.
3. Run install_dependencies.py by executing the command ```python install_dependencies.py``` or on linux, ```sudo python install_dependencies.py```

on the command prompt in the Virtual-Mouthpiece directory.

This file will install all necessary python and node dependencies needed to run Virtual-Mouthpiece.
## Running the Server
The server is the computer that you will use to create slideshows on and choose which display to send them to.
To start the server, execute the following commands from the terminal/command prompt in the `Virtual-Mouthpiece` directory:

```python Server_Main.py```
or on linux, ```sudo python Server_Main.py```.

on the command prompt in the Virtual-Mouthpiece directory.
After running this command, a browser window should open with the main Virtual-Mouthpiece screen.
Also, in the terminal, you should see a message that says

```Project is running at http://###.##.###.###```

where `###.##.###.###` is your computer's IP address.

üìù *Make a note of this for starting client instances.*

## Running a Display Client
The display client is the computer that is directly connected to the display.
To run an instance of the client,
1. Run `Display_Client_Main.py` by executing the following commands from the terminal/command prompt in the `Virtual-Mouthpiece` directory: ```python Server_Main.py```. Or, on linux, ```sudo python Server_Main.py```.
2. You will next be prompted to choose a configuration option.
   1. If this is not your first time connecting to the current server computer, you have the option to use the last used configuration option.
   2. If this is the first time connecting to a server computer, choose the option to create a new configuration.
      1. When selecting your configuration options, the server ip address from the previous section will be necessary for the display client to know which computer to connect to.

Once a configuration has been set, the display client should be running. If the server is already running and you do not see the display client's name, refresh the page.
